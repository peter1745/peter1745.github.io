<h2 id="about-me"><a class="header" href="#about-me">About Me</a></h2>
<p>Hi, my name is Peter, and I'm a game engine developer from Sweden, I'm also the author of this guide. I've been working on a game engine called <a href="https://www.hazelengine.com/">Hazel</a> for over a year, and one of the things I've worked on is a C# scripting engine, using the Mono library.</p>
<p>Hazel is not my own personal engine, and it was originally created by <a href="https://thecherno.com/">Yan Chernikov</a>. I joined the project in September of 2020 as a volunteer, and now I'm lucky enough to be able to work on it as an actual job.</p>
<h2 id="the-goal-of-this-guide"><a class="header" href="#the-goal-of-this-guide">The goal of this guide</a></h2>
<p>The goal of this guide is to help you embed the <a href="https://www.mono-project.com/">Mono</a> library into your game engine. For the past few months I've been working on rewriting the C# scripting engine in Hazel, and I kept getting frustrated because there's very little in terms of useful documentation on how to use Mono in the scope of a game engine.</p>
<p>Yes, Mono <em>does</em> have a documentation site for embedding: <a href="http://docs.go-mono.com/?link=root%3a%2fembed">http://docs.go-mono.com/</a>, but in my experience it's all but useless. There are a few open source (or at least source available) projects out there that have embedded Mono, but there's no real <em>documentation</em> available.</p>
<p><strong>So</strong>, that's why I decided to create this guide. I've been through the pain of googling for hours to figure out how to do something in Mono, and I figured I could help spare others from that pain.</p>
<p>Before we get started I just wanted to say that this guide is <strong>not</strong> a guide on building a complete scripting engine, it's just meant to give you the knowledge you <em>need</em> to write a scripting engine.</p>
<h2 id="credits"><a class="header" href="#credits">Credits</a></h2>
<p>I'm not the only person who has contributed to this. I've had some help with certain parts of it, so I wanted to make sure to mention anyone that has helped out.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Marca</strong>, provided build instructions for Mac OSX</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="about-mono"><a class="header" href="#about-mono">About Mono</a></h1>
<h2 id="what-is-mono"><a class="header" href="#what-is-mono">What <em>is</em> Mono?</a></h2>
<p>I would assume that you already know what Mono is since you decided to check out this guide, but I'll give a short explanation just in case.</p>
<p>In short: Mono is an open source implementation of Microsoft's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework">.NET Framework</a>. It was originally designed to bring .NET languages (mostly C#) to platforms other than Windows.
Nowadays it's not strictly necessary for cross-platform support, since Microsoft has been working on making .NET cross-platform natively. But Mono is still very useful for scripting engines, because unlike .NET Core, or .NET Framework, it provides a decent C/C++ API for embedding a .NET runtime.</p>
<h2 id="multiple-versions-of-mono"><a class="header" href="#multiple-versions-of-mono">Multiple versions of Mono?</a></h2>
<p>Now, there are actually <em>two</em> versions of Mono, there's what I call &quot;Classic Mono&quot;, which is mainly what we'll be covering here, then there's what I call the &quot;.NET Core Mono&quot;. I won't get into the differences between .NET Core and .NET Framework, but the biggest difference is that classic Mono only supports up to C# 7, or .NET Framework 4.7.2, where as .NET Core Mono supports the latest version of C#, and is developed as part of the .NET Runtime project.</p>
<p>Both versions of Mono are developed by Microsoft, but classic Mono isn't <em>integrated</em> into .NET, where as .NET Core Mono <em>is</em>. I will eventually cover building the .NET Core version of Mono as well, but I'll start by covering classic Mono because it's simpler, and more suited for game engines (I'll explain why later on).</p>
<h2 id="why-not-use-the-net-core-version"><a class="header" href="#why-not-use-the-net-core-version">Why not use the .NET Core version?</a></h2>
<p>So, why aren't we going to use the .NET Core version of Mono? Simply put: It doesn't support <em>assembly reloading</em>. If you don't know what C# assemblies are I'd recommend you read up a bit on them, but they're essentially a DLL file that contains all your code, converted to an intermediate language (commonly referred to as &quot;IL&quot; or &quot;Bytecode&quot;).</p>
<p>So why does assembly reloading matter in this case? Because when you, or anyone else, is writing C# scripts you want the changes you make to the code to take effect in the engine (or editor) immediately, without having to restart the entire editor / game. And in order to do so we first have to unload the old assembly, and load in the new one, without restarting the program.</p>
<p>And in its current state the .NET Core version of Mono doesn't support unloading C# assemblies, where as classic Mono does. When I was initially rewriting the scripting engine for Hazel I wanted to use the .NET Core version because it would've meant that we could support the latest C# version. And unfortunately I only discovered that assembly unloading wasn't supported about 3 months into rewriting the scripting engine...</p>
<p>As it was I got in touch with the developers of Mono to ask them if it was possible to reload assemblies in any way, and they told me no. So I asked them if they knew <em>when</em> that would be supported, and they told me they didn't know... (Yes, I may still be <em>slightly</em> annoyed with them for releasing the .NET Core version without assembly reloading support)</p>
<p>But <strong>when</strong> the .NET Core version supports assembly reloading I'll make sure to update this book with instructions on how to use that version of Mono (assuming I remember doing so).</p>
<p>But regardless, let's move on to cloning Mono from GitHub, and building the necessary libraries in the next chapter!</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="building-mono"><a class="header" href="#building-mono">Building Mono</a></h1>
<p>Building Mono isn't too hard, but it's a large library, taking up quite a lot of space on your computer, so it will probably take some time to clone, and build it.</p>
<h2 id="platforms"><a class="header" href="#platforms">Platforms</a></h2>
<p>Here are some links to the instructions for each platform:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="introduction/building-mono.html#windows">Windows</a></li>
<li><a href="introduction/building-mono.html#linux">Linux (Coming Soon!)</a></li>
<li><a href="introduction/building-mono.html#macosx">Mac OSX</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cloning-from-github"><a class="header" href="#cloning-from-github">Cloning from GitHub</a></h2>
<p>Before we can build Mono, we have to clone it from GitHub. You should hopefully know how to do this yourself, but I know <em>someone</em> won't know how to do that so I'm including this section anyway.</p>
<p>If you don't need a step-by-step guide for this, you should just clone <a href="https://github.com/mono/mono">https://github.com/mono/mono</a>.</p>
<p>Alright, in order to clone Mono make sure you have a Git client installed, I'll be providing commands for the command-line git client, but you could also use a GUI client.</p>
<p>In order to clone Mono from the command line, you just run <code>git clone https://github.com/mono/mono</code>, that's it. Yeah I know, this section feels pointless but might as well include it.</p>
<h2 id="building-classic-mono-from-source"><a class="header" href="#building-classic-mono-from-source">Building classic Mono from source</a></h2>
<p>Now we get to the fun part: building Mono from source. Mono is a pretty large project so building Mono can take a bit of time. I'll provide build instructions for Windows, MacOS and Linux (I'll be using Linux Mint when building).</p>
<p>I'll provide the pre-requisites that you'll need to build Mono on the specified platform as to save you some thinking power and pain.</p>
<h3 id="windows"><a class="header" href="#windows">Windows</a></h3>
<p>Building Mono on Windows is <em>ridiculously</em> easy, most likely easier than any other platform. I will note that using Visual Studio only works for building the Mono runtime libraries, not the .NET libraries (e.g <code>System.dll</code>, <code>System.Collections.Generic.dll</code>, etc...).</p>
<p>In my case I won't be building the .NET libraries from source, I'll be getting them by installing Mono locally and copying them from the install directory.</p>
<p>If you want to build the .NET libraries you'll need access to the <code>make</code> command, which you can use by running a <a href="https://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> shell.</p>
<h4 id="pre-requisites"><a class="header" href="#pre-requisites">Pre Requisites</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>An installed copy of Mono (might not be required but it's good to have just in case)</li>
<li>Visual Studio (I'll be using Visual Studio 2022)</li>
<li>Cygwin or some other tool that let's you use <code>make</code> (Only needed if you want to build the .NET libraries)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="building"><a class="header" href="#building">Building</a></h4>
<p>In order to build Mono you just need to navigate to <code>mono/msvc/</code> and open up <strong>mono.sln</strong> in Visual Studio. All you need to do now is select the build configuration and the platform to build for.</p>
<p>I recommend building both the <code>Release</code> and the <code>Debug</code> configuration since only building <code>Release</code> will mean you'll have an even harder time debugging Mono related issues. If you want to build 64-bit or 32-bit doesn't really matter for the sake of this guide, but these days you really don't need to support 32-bit platforms.
After that just start the build and let it run!</p>
<p>If you've done everything correctly (which I assume you have since it's not hard building Mono on Windows) you can move on to the &quot;Getting the Necessary Files&quot; chapter.</p>
<h3 id="linux"><a class="header" href="#linux">Linux</a></h3>
<p><strong>Coming Soon!</strong></p>
<h3 id="macosx"><a class="header" href="#macosx">MacOSX</a></h3>
<p>Building Mono on Mac is very similar to Linux, you still use <code>make</code> and <code>autogen</code>.</p>
<h4 id="pre-requisites-1"><a class="header" href="#pre-requisites-1">Pre-Requisites</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>An installed copy of Mono (only if you don't get <code>monolite</code>)</li>
<li>Make</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="building-1"><a class="header" href="#building-1">Building</a></h4>
<p>The first step is to open a terminal and navigate to the root <code>mono</code> folder.</p>
<p>Before you continue, keep in mind that running <code>./autogen.sh</code> will cause Mono to clone all the submodules that it will need to build, this process takes quite a long time. Once you're in the root Mono folder you'll want to start by running this command: <code>./autogen.sh --prefix=&lt;absolutePathToDesiredOutputDirectory&gt; --disable-nls</code>.</p>
<p>Once that command has finished, you'll want to either install Mono locally, or get <code>monolite</code>. If you have Mono installed locally, just continue to the next step, if you want to use <code>monolite</code> however, you'll have to run: <code>make get-monolite-latest</code> in order to get it.</p>
<p>Once you have Mono or <code>monolite</code> you'll want to run <code>make</code>, and then <code>make install</code> to build Mono.</p>
<p>All the necessary libraries should've been placed in the folder you specified as part of the <code>--prefix</code> flag.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="getting-the-necessary-files"><a class="header" href="#getting-the-necessary-files">Getting the Necessary Files</a></h1>
<p>Now it's time for us to get all the necessary files that we'll need to embed the Mono runtime. This includes the Mono libraries and the .NET libraries. Naturally the files are called different things and located in different places depending on the platform, but I'll provide the necessary files and locations for Windows, MacOSX and Linux.</p>
<p>You can use these links to quickly jump to your platform:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="introduction/necessary-files.html#windows">Windows</a></li>
<li><a href="introduction/necessary-files.html#linux">Linux (Coming Soon!)</a></li>
<li><a href="introduction/necessary-files.html#macosx">Mac OSX</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="windows-1"><a class="header" href="#windows-1">Windows</a></h2>
<h3 id="native-libraries"><a class="header" href="#native-libraries">Native Libraries</a></h3>
<p>All of Mono's native libraries should've been built into <code>mono-root/msvc/build/sgen/{platform}/</code>, where <code>{platform}</code> is either <code>x64</code> or <code>Win32</code>.</p>
<p>In that folder you'll see three other folders called <code>bin</code>, <code>lib</code> and <code>obj</code>, we're only interested in the <code>bin</code> and <code>lib</code> folders.
Both of those will have either one or two subfolders based on if you built both <code>Release</code> and <code>Debug</code>, or only <code>Release</code> or only <code>Debug</code>.</p>
<p>I will only be telling you <em>what</em> files you'll need, how <em>you</em> choose to structure your projects dependencies is up to you.</p>
<p>So, here's the native libraries that you'll need from <code>lib</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>eglib.lib</li>
<li>libgcmonosgen.lib</li>
<li>libmini-sgen.lib</li>
<li>libmonoruntime-sgen.lib</li>
<li>libmono-static-sgen.lib</li>
<li>libmonoutils.lib</li>
<li>mono-2.0-sgen.lib</li>
<li>MonoPosixHelper.lib</li>
</ul>
<p>You're also going to need some files from the <code>bin</code> folder, these files will have to be placed next to your applications executable. These are the DLL files you'll need from <code>bin</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>mono-2.0-sgen.dll</li>
<li>MonoPosixHelper.dll</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="net-libraries"><a class="header" href="#net-libraries">.NET Libraries</a></h3>
<p>You don't technically <strong>have</strong> to copy the .NET libraries into your own program, you can tell the Mono runtime where they're located, but I like having them be a part of the project, so I'll be copying them.</p>
<p>I won't be providing a full list of the files that you'll need, there's a lot of them, instead I'll just tell you what folders you'll need to copy.</p>
<p>If you've installed Mono locally (not just cloned it) you'll have to navigate to the folder where you installed it, in my case I installed it to <code>C:\Program Files\Mono</code>. Inside that install folder you'll want to navigate to <code>lib/mono</code>, and you should see a bunch of folders that have numbers, and some that have an <code>-api</code> postfix.</p>
<p>The main folder you'll want is the one called <code>4.5</code>, just make sure you copy it into a <code>lib</code> folder, located inside of a folder called <code>mono</code>. In my case it would be <code>D:\dev\MyGameEngine\MyEditor\mono\lib</code>.
I may end up covering the other folders at a later date, but I have only recently started experimenting with them myself so I don't want to provide incorrect information here.</p>
<p>If you built the .NET libraries from source you'll have to navigate to <code>mono-root/mcs/class/corlib</code>, and you <em>should</em> find the same folders there. I haven't done this myself so I could be incorrect, if so please open an issue in the GitHub repo for this page.

<p>Getting the correct header files is really easy, they're located in <code>mono-root/msvc/include/</code>. You'll probably want to copy the <code>mono</code> folder, so that when you go to include a Mono header file you type <code>#include &lt;mono/somedir/somefile.h&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>That's it! You've now got all the files you'll need to embed the Mono runtime.</p>
<p>Before we continue I will say that <em>most</em> of the time you'll only need to link with <code>mono-2.0-sgen.lib</code>, but you should still keep the other .lib files around in case you need them later on, or you can delete them if you want to minimize the size of your project as much as possible.</p>
<p>Also remember to at the very least copy <code>mono-2.0-sgen.dll</code> to the same folder as your applications executable.</p>

<h3 id="native-libraries-1"><a class="header" href="#native-libraries-1">Native Libraries</a></h3>
<p>All the necessary native libraries you'll need should be located in the output folder that you specified when you built Mono. You'll find a folder called <code>lib</code> in there, that's where the libraries are located.</p>
<p>So, here's the native libraries that you'll need from <code>lib</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>libeglib.a</li>
<li>libmonoutils.a</li>
<li>libMonoPosixHelper.dylib</li>
<li>libmonosgen-2.0.dylib (This is most likely a symlink for libmonosgen-2.0.1.dylib)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="net-libraries-1"><a class="header" href="#net-libraries-1">.NET Libraries</a></h3>
<p>You don't technically <strong>have</strong> to copy the .NET libraries into your own program, you can tell the Mono runtime where they're located, but I like having them be a part of the project, so I'll be copying them.</p>
<p>I won't be providing a full list of the files that you'll need, there's a lot of them, instead I'll just tell you what folders you'll need to copy.</p>
<p>If you've installed Mono locally (not just cloned it) you'll have to navigate to the folder where you installed it. Inside that install folder you'll want to navigate to <code>lib/mono</code>, and you should see a bunch of folders that have numbers, and some that have an <code>-api</code> postfix.</p>
<p>The main folder you'll want is the one called <code>4.5</code>, just make sure you copy it into a <code>lib</code> folder, located inside of a folder called <code>mono</code>.
I may end up covering the other folders at a later date, but I have only recently started experimenting with them myself so I don't want to provide incorrect information here.</p>
<p>If you built the .NET libraries from source you'll have to navigate to the output directory that you specified when you built Mono, and navigate to <code>lib/mono/</code>, and you <em>should</em> find the same folders there. I haven't done this myself so I could be incorrect, if so please open an issue in the GitHub repo for this page.

<p>Alright, now you should have all the necessary files, and your project <em>should</em> be configured correctly, but if you don't know how to e.g link the Mono libraries to your project, or add the include directory, well, then <em>maybe</em> you shouldn't be considering embedding Mono just yet.</p>
<p>Once you've got your project configured and linking with Mono, feel free to move on to the &quot;Setting up the Runtime&quot; section of this guide!</p>
