                                    Hi there! My name is Peter Nilsson, and I'm a professional Software Engineer from Sweden. This is a little bit about who I am, but if you're
                                    only interested in what I <i>do</i> then you can scroll down a bit and read the "<b>What I Do</b>" section.
                                </p>
                                <p class="card-text fs-5">
                                    So, who am I? Well for starters I'm 23 years old, born in the summer of 1999. I grew up in a small town in <br /> central / northern Sweden (depending on who you ask).
                                    <br />
                                    That's me in the picture in case that wasn't obvious already. I currently live 10 kilometers from where I grew up, along with my partner and our two cats.
                                    Until the start of 2022 I worked as a healthcare orderly (I mainly worked with old people), at which point I was mainly programming as a volunteer during my free time.
                                    Around April of 2022 I was finally hired by the company I'd been doing volunteer work for, but I'll talk more about that in the next section.
                                </p>

                <div class="row gx-4 gx-lg-5 justify-content-center">
                    <div class="col-md-10 col-lg-8 col-xl-2">

                    <div class="col-md-10 col-lg-8 col-xl-7">
                        <div class="card bg-transparent border-0">
                            <div class="card-body">
                                <h2 class="card-title">What I Do</h2>
                                <p class="card-text fs-5">
                                    So what do I actually do? Well I'm a Software Engineer as previously stated, and I mainly work in C++ and C#, writing games and game engines.
                                    At the start of 2022 I was hired by Studio Cherno to work part time on the <a href="https://hazelengine.com" target="_blank">Hazel</a> game engine.
                                    <br />
                                    As part of Studio Cherno I've also competed in the <a href="https://ldjam.com/" target="_blank">Ludum Dare</a> game jam twice (Ludum Dare 50 & 51), and
                                    during Ludum Dare 51 I even acted as the lead game designer, writing 90% of the C# gameplay code.
                                    <br />
                                    Recently I was also asked to pick up some web server work, which eventually led me to decide to redesign my personal website as well.
                                    <br />
                                    But, what do I <i>actually</i> work on? Well I'm in charge of developing the physics and scripting systems in Hazel, and write most of the gameplay code
                                    for any games we may want to build. My work on the scripting engine led me to start writing a guide on using the <a href="https://www.mono-project.com/" target="_blank">Mono</a> library
                                    to implement C# scripting, you can find that guide under the "Projects" dropdown.
                                    <br />
                                    While I do find C# scripting facinating I'm far more passionate about the physics in Hazel, especially considering my first ever contribution to Hazel
                                    was adding the PhysX library. I'll probably write a blog post about the physics in Hazel, and my journey with the different physics libraries out there at some point.

                                <p class="card-text fs-5">
                                    Apart from working at Studio Cherno I also tend to do some programming during my free time. Sometime in August of 2022 I decided to start
                                    working on my <i>own</i> game engine called Fusion during my spare time, as a hobby project.
                                    <br />
                                    Whenever I tell people that they always ask <i>"So you get home from work and immediately go back to woring on game engines?"</i>, to which
                                    my answer is: <i>Yes</i>.
                                    <br />
                                    Now why would I do that? Don't I want to relax and take it easy after a days work? Well the main reason for me developing Fusion is as a learning opportunity.
                                    See, while I've learned a lot from working at Studio Cherno I mainly focus on physics and scripting, meaning there's little opportunity for me to learn
                                    other parts of game engines like graphics programming, audio programming, etc...
                                    <br />
                                    Not to mention making my own engine entirely from scratch allows me to improve at architecting a game engine in general, and it gives
                                    me a playground to mess about in.
                                    <br />
                                    Currently Fusion is in it's infancy, but I intend to keep developing it for as long as possible. If you want to know more about Fusion you can check out
                                    the project page for it <a href="#">here</a>. (Once I actually create it that is)
