{"title":"Welcome to my Website!","heading":"The Ramblings of a Tired Man","content":"Welcome to my website! Here I'll most likely dump whatever random thoughts pop into my head <i>(assuming it's related to programming)</i>.<br>I'll also be posting information about my projects under the \"Projects\" tab, so keep an eye on that tab!<br><br><i>FYI: Prepare from some severe ramblings. I was tired when I wrote this, in fact I haven't slept for over 24 hours as of me writing this scentence.</i><br><br><h2> The Mono Guide</h2>As some of you might know this website used to host a guide that I was writing that was meant to help people get started with the Mono library.<br>A few months ago I decided to abandon the guide, mainly because I lost interest in developing it further. I would like to change the guide into a video format in the future, but I currently don't know when I would have time to sit down and record a bunch of videos.<br><br>So you can consider this the <b>official</b> notice that the Mono guide will no longer be actively developed on this website. I've still ensured that it's available, you can visit <a href=\"/mono-guide/book/\" target=\"_blank\">this</a> link if you're interested in reading it, or you can find it under the \"Projects\" tab.<br><br><h2> What I'm currently working on</h2>I'm currently working on a couple of different projects. The ones listed here are the ones I'm focused on the most:<br><ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/peter1745/Fusion\" target=\"_blank\">Fusion</a></li><li>This website</li><li>Some backend related stuff for Studio Cherno</li><li>The <a href=\"https://hazelengine.com\" target=\"_blank\">Hazel</a> engine</li><li>Life</li></ul><br><h2> Live Streams</h2>So I used to stream pretty regularly over on <a href=\"https://twitch.tv/peter1745\" target=\"_blank\">Twitch</a>, but since the end Ludum Dare 51 I've been extremely inconsistent with the streaming.<br>This is something I want to change, I just haven't had the mental energy to actually start a stream (<i>Sounds silly, I know.</i>). There are a few reasons for why I've been drained as of late, and I can't really go into most of them for personal reasons.<br><br>My current goal is to start slowly, beginning with streaming once a week for the entirety of December. I guess the upside of this whole live stream situation is that I've been a <i>lot</i> more active in the community.<br><br><h2> What's with this blog?</h2>I decided to setup this blog partly because I want a place where I can dump whatever random ideas I have, regardless of the quality.<br>But part of the reason is that I'm considering yeeting off Twitter. Mainly because I don't really <i>consume</i> any content on Twitter anymore, I just sort of end up scrolling aimlessly for fifteen minutes.<br><br><i>But it's also because Twitter is a burning dumpster fire right now.</i><br><br>My general opinion of social media has shifted heavily over the past two years, I ended up disabling my Facebook account because it was a toxic dump, now I'm considering getting rid of Twitter, and some of the pure mobile based social media platforms that I'm part of.<br><br>Bit of a tangent there, but yeah I have a blog now. I'll probably write a post about how I actually built the blog (I ended up designing a custom Markdown parser so I could write these posts faster, I'll definitely talk about that).<br><br>Either way I don't really have anything else to talk about here, so I'll just end it with this: Thanks for taking the time to read this post!","date":"November 23, 2022"}
